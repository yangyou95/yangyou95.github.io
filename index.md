# About me

I'm a MSc student in Robotics

## SCIENTIFIC PROJECTS
#### **Robot Learning for Dual Arm Manipulation**, Qianyuan Liu, Xuemei Ye, **YANG YOU**

> A novel method of controlling dual arm Manipulation with deep reinforcement learning algorithms  [[Report]](./assets/reports/DRL_Research.pdf).


#### **Fast failure detection in robotics using supervised learning method with convolutional gaussian processes**, **YANG YOU**



> Abstract— The execution failure is a classical problem in
robotics and much progress has been observed in recent
years with supervised learning methods. In this paper, a
method, which applying gaussian kernel convoluted data
then using different machine learning algorithms and neural
networks method to perform this classification task, shows
a higher accuracy in prediction and less time consuming in
training than the existing methods without convolution process.

#### **JDX Robotics Competition**, Xuemei Ye, **YANG YOU**

> A mobile robot with arms and end effectors, which can perform picking and placing tasks in various environments.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

#### **Fast failure detection in robotics using supervised learning method with convolutional gaussian processes**, **YANG YOU**



> Abstractâ€” The execution failure is a classical problem in
robotics and much progress has been observed in recent
years with supervised learning methods. In this paper, a
method, which applying gaussian kernel convoluted data
then using different machine learning algorithms and neural
networks method to perform this classification task, shows
a higher accuracy in prediction and less time consuming in
training than the existing methods without convolution process.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

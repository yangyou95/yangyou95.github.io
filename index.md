# About me

I am a Ph.D student in Robotics & Computer Science. My research interests are decision-making and planning methods under uncertainties for the robots.

**Update 2023/02/22, I have successfully defended my PhD thesis and I am a Ph.D right now! :D**

## <br> Skills
* ROS
* C/C++, python
* Decision-Making & Planning

<!-- #### **Robot Learning for Dual Arm Manipulation**, Qianyuan Liu, Xuemei Ye, **YANG YOU**

> A novel method of controlling dual arm Manipulation which is based on MADDPG and HER (deep reinforcement learning algorithms).  

#### **Agent Chasing learning with ACKTR**, shuoying Liang, **YANG YOU**

> A game with angry bird-like background, reward is calculated by the subsutraction of the disance wanted and real distance between the agent and the goal's position.
> ACKTR is implented with asynchronous process. By limiting the KL divergence, the optimal direction in paramter space can be guided by the natural gradient.

#### **Fast failure detection in robotics using supervised learning method with convolutional gaussian processes**, **YANG YOU**



> Abstract— The execution failure is a classical problem in
robotics and much progress has been observed in recent
years with supervised learning methods. In this paper, a
method, which applying gaussian kernel convoluted data
then using different machine learning algorithms and neural
networks method to perform this classification task, shows
a higher accuracy in prediction and less time consuming in
training than the existing methods without convolution process.

#### **JDX Robotics Competition**, Xuemei Ye, **YANG YOU**

> A mobile robot with arms and end effectors, which can perform picking and placing tasks in various environments.
> [[Slides(ch)]](./assets/reports/slides_ch.pptx)

#### **Image Processing with different kernels**, **YANG YOU**

> Image processing is a widely used technique in many areas such as machine learning, medical inspection and camera applications. In this experiment, various kernels are used to perform the image processing task. This report aims at describing the approaches which are used, discussing the advantages and disadvantages among those filters.
